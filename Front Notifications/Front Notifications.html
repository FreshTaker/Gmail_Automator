4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 202 | Bethesda, MD 20814
Dear Members:
Last month, we shared a message regarding Merck's anticipated TICE BCG supply constraints due to an
increasing global demand for the product.
To minimize disruption to patient care, Merck (the sole supplier of BCG to the United States) announced
an immediate change to their TICE BCG distribution model, and in January, ceased all drop shipments
and began allocating TICE BCG exclusively to wholesalers and distributors based on product supply and
historical purchasing patterns. Wholesalers and distributors in turn, began utilizing the same allocation
model to fulfill customer orders directly; therefore, please contact your wholesaler should you have any
questions about your allotment.
Although Merck is exploring options to increase their production of TICE BCG, they expect this global
supply constraint to continue throughout 2019.
The American Urological Association (AUA), American Association of Clinical Urologists (AACU), Bladder
Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN), Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO), the Large Urology Group Practice
Association (LUGPA) and the Urology Care Foundation (UCF) remain extremely concerned about this
shortage and its effects on the care of bladder cancer patients. Efforts to engage the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration to approve additional strains and supplies of BCG are ongoing and all organizations
noted above continue to communicate with Merck for the most up-to-date information on this issue.
Until the shortage has been resolved, the following strategies may help maximize the care for patients
with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC), subject, as always, to physician judgment in
individual cases:
1. BCG should not be used for patients with low-risk disease.
2. Intravesical chemotherapy should be used as the first-line option for patients with
intermediate-risk NMIBC. Patients with recurrent/multifocal low-grade Ta lesions who require
intravesical therapy should receive intravesical chemotherapy such as mitomycin, gemcitabine,
epirubicin or docetaxel instead of BCG.
3. If BCG would be administered as second-line therapy for patients with intermediate-risk
NMIBC, an alternative intravesical chemotherapy should be used rather than BCG in the setting
of this BCG shortage.
4. For patients with high-risk NMIBC, high-grade T1 and CIS patients receiving induction
therapy, they should be prioritized for use of full-strength BCG. If not available, these patients
and other high-risk patients should be given a reduced 1/2 to 1/3 dose, if feasible.
5. If supply exists for maintenance therapy for patients with NMIBC, every attempt should be
made to use 1/3 dose BCG and limit dose to one year.
6. In the event of BCG supply shortage, maintenance therapy should not be given and BCGnaïve patients with high-risk disease should be prioritized for induction BCG.
7. If BCG is not available, a preferable alternative to BCG is mitomycin (induction and monthly
maintenance up to one year). Other options such as gemcitabine, epirubicin, docetaxel,
valrubicin or sequential gemcitabine/docetaxel or gemcitabine/mitomycin may also be
considered with an induction and possible maintenance regimen.
8. Patients with high-risk features (i.e., high-grade T1 with additional risk factors such as
concomitant carcinoma in situ, lymphovascular invasion, prostatic urethral involvement or
variant histology) who are not willing to take any potential oncologic risks with alternative
intravesical agents, should be offered initial radical cystectomy, if they are surgical candidates.
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
If 1/2 to 1/3 dose BCG is used, every attempt should be made to treat multiple patients on the same
day, while being consistent with product labeling, to avoid drug wastage. It is recommended 
Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network | www.BCAN.org | 1-888-901-BCAN | info@bcan.org
4915 St. Elmo Avenue, Suite 202 | Bethesda, MD 20814
practitioners communicate with their pharmacy to ensure that if split dosing is used, it is done with
appropriate safety precautions.
As always, it is important these decisions be made after an informed discussion with the individual
patient regarding their treatment options in the context of the ongoing BCG shortage.
Note: It is recognized there are legitimate concerns around split-vial dosing of BCG. It is unknown at this
time whether it is acceptable to bill for more than one patient per vial of BCG. The AUA has been in
contact with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and is awaiting billing guidance for
practices implementing split-vial dosing, if allowed in the Medicare program. At this time, the AUA
suggests confirmation with any insurance company prior to splitting vials.
Every effort should be made to enroll patients in clinical trials to offer an appropriate alternative
management strategy where this is feasible.
Review the official AUA/SUO Risk Stratification Table for NMIBC.
We will continue to update you as we receive additional information.
Sincerely,
